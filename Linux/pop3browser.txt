NAME
       pop3browser -- small perl script to access POP3 mail accounts

DESCRIPTION
       pop3browser is a perl script that uses libnet-perl to give access to POP3 mail accounts without fetching the messages.

       pop3browser  can  be used to delete unwanted mails (SPAM), especially when they come with large attachments, before downloading them over low-bandwidth connections. The --limit option of fetchmail
       is very useful to filter such large mails which can then be inspected with pop3browser.

       The program supports normal POP3 authentication and APOP.

USAGE
       pop3browser welcomes you with a short copyright note and a command line prompt. The settings for a mailbox (host, password etc.) have to be specified in a configuration  file  (similar  to  fetch‐
       mail).  pop3browser understands the following commands:

       hosts  list available hosts specified in .pop3browserrc

       login n
              log into host no. n, use 'hosts' to get a list of available hosts

       o(pen) n
              same as login

       apop n same as login but uses APOP

       c(lose)
              delete messages marked for deletion and close current connection

       list   list sizes and message numbers of the mails on the account

       s(how) n
              show header and some body lines of mail number n

       m(ailbox)
               list message number, size, sender and subject for each mail

       d(elete) n
              delete mail number n

       undel(ete) n
              undelete mail number n

       k(ill) expr
              delete mails matching expr in header

       u(nkill) expr
              undelete mails matching expr in header

       q(uit) delete messages marked for deletion and quit program

       exit   same as quit

       help   print a command summary

CONFIG FILE
       The  definitions  for  a  mailbox  are  specified in ~/.pop3browserrc.  One line per mailbox. Lines starting with # are ignored.  Each definition must be in the following form:.br hostname <tab or
       space> userid <tab or space> password <tab or space> protocol (optional)

       For example:
       #definition for bar@pop.foo.com
       #pop-server          UID passwd protocol
       pop.foo.com          bar s3cr3t apop
       #end of definition

       Recognised options for the protocol are pop3 and apop. If no protocol is specified the command login/open assumes pop3.  The command apop ignores the protocol option.

       To override the default header-filter of the show command you can specify a custom set of keywords  in  ~/.pop3browserrc.   Lines  starting  with  "@headpattern"  or  "@bodylines"  are  parsed  by
       pop3browser. Settings for the header-filter must be in the following form:
       @headpattern <tab or space> = <tab or space> "<keyword1>","<keyword2>",....
       The filter keywords are matched against the start of a header line.
       Settings for the number of body lines to show, have to be in the following form:
       @bodylines <tab or space> = <tab or space> <Number>
       Example:
       @headpatterns = "From:","To:","Subject:","Date:","CC"
       @bodylines = 10

       The file ~/.pop3browserrc must only be readable for the owning user. pop3browser corrects other file modes automatically.
