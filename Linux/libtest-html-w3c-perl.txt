NAME
       Test::HTML::W3C - Perform W3C HTML validation testing

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::HTML::W3C tests => $test_count;
         # or
         use Test::HTML::W3C 'show_detail';
         # or when using both
         use Test::HTML::W3C tests => $test_count, 'show_detail';

         is_valid_markup($my_html_scalar);

         is_valid_file("/path/to/my/file.html");

         is_valid("http://example.com");

         # Get the underlying WebService:;Validator::W3C::HTML object
         my $validator = validator();

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of this module is to provide a wrapper around the W3C that works with the Test::More testing framework.

ABUSE
       Please keep in mind that the W3C validation pages and services are a shared resource. If you plan to do many many tests, please consider using your own installation of the validation programs, and
       then use your local install by modifying the local validtor:

         my $v = validator();
         $v->validator_uri($my_own_validator);

       See the documentation for WebService:;Validator::W3C::HTML and the W3C's site at http://validator.w3.org/ for details

       validator();
           Description: Returns the underlying WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C object

           Parameters: None.

           Returns: $validator

       plan();
           Description: Access to the underlying "plan" method provided by Test::Builder.

           Parameters: As per Test::Builder

       is_valid_markup($markup[, $name]);
           Description:  is_valid_markup  tests whether the text in the provided scalar value correctly validates according to the W3C specifications. This is useful if you have markup stored in a scalar
           that you wish to test that  you might get from using LWP or WWW::Mechanize for example...

           Parameters: $markup, a scalar containing the data to test, $name, an optional descriptive test name.

           Returns: None.

       is_valid_file($path[, $name]);
           Description: is_valid_file works the same way as is_valid_markup, except that you can specify the text to validate with the path to a filename. This is useful if you have pregenerated all your
           HTML files locally, and now wish to test them.

           Parameters: $path, a scalar, $name, an optional descriptive test name.

           Returns: None.

       is_valid($url[, $name]);
           Description: is_valid, again, works very similarly to the is_valid_file and is_valid_file, except you specify a document that is already online with its URL. This can be useful if you wish  to
           periodically  test a website or webpage that dynamically changes over time for example, like a blog or a wiki, without first saving the html to a file using your browswer, or a utility such as
           wget.

           Parameters: $url, a scalar, $name, an optional descriptive test name.

           Returns: None.

       diag_html($url);
           Description: If you want to display the actual errors reported by the service for a particular test, you can use the diag_html function.  Please note that you must have imported  'show_detail'
           for this to work properly.

             use Test::HTML::W3C 'show_detail';

             is_valid_markup("<html></html">, "My simple test") or diag_html();

           Parameters: $url, a scalar.

           Returns: None.
