DAB(6)                         BSD Games Manual                         DAB(6)

NAME
     dab — Dots and Boxes game

SYNOPSIS
     dab [-aw] [-n ngames] [-p ⟨c|h⟩⟨c|h⟩] [xdim [ydim]]

DESCRIPTION
     dab is a game where each player tries to complete the most boxes.  A turn
     consists of putting one border of a box; the player setting the fourth
     and final border of a box gets the point for the box and has another
     turn.

     The keys used are the vi keys: k for up, j for down, h for left, and l
     for right.  To switch between even and odd rows, use one of the following
     keys: u (diagonal right up), y (diagonal left up), b (diagonal left
     down), n (diagonal right down); ⟨space⟩ sets a new border, CTRL-L and
     CTRL-R redraw the screen, and q quits the game.

     Support options are:

     -a               Don't use the alternate character set.

     -n ngames        ngames games will be played.  (Especially useful in -p
                      cc mode.)

     -p ⟨c|h⟩⟨c|h⟩    Select which of the two players is a human or a com‐
                      puter.  The first argument is the first player; c stands
                      for computer and h for human.

     -w               Wait for a character press between games.

     xdim and ydim define the size of the board in the x and y dimensions.
