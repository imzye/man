NAME
       rpm-plugin-ima - IMA plugin for the RPM Package Manager

Description
       Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) and the Linux Extended Verification Module (EVM) allow to detect when files have been accidentally or maliciously altered.  This plugin puts IMA/EVM signatures
       in the security.ima extended file attribute during installation.  This requires packages to contain the signatures - typically by being signed with rpmsign --signfiles.

Configuration
       The %_ima_sign_config_files macro controls whether signatures should also be written for config files.

       See rpm-plugins(8) on how to control plugins in general.
