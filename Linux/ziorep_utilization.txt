NAME
       ziorep_utilization - Utilization report for FCP adapters.

SYNOPSIS
       ziorep_utilization [-V] [-v] [-h] [-b <begin>] [-e <end>] [-i <time>] [-s] [-c <chpid>] [-x] [-t <num>] <filename>

DESCRIPTION
       ziorep_utilization Prints a report from the specified data.

OPTIONS
       -h or --help
              Print help information, then exit.

       -v or --version
              Print version information, then exit.

       -V or --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -b or --begin
              Limit the timeframe to consider to data beginning with the specified date.
              Dates must be specified in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS].
              E.g. 2008-03-21 09:08 is 9:08 on March 21, 2008.

       -e or --end
              Limit the timeframe to consider to data ending with the specified date.
              Dates must be specified in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS].
              E.g. 2008-03-21 09:08 is 9:08 on March 21, 2008.

       -i or --interval
              Specify an aggregation interval. The interval is given in seconds, and must be a multiple of the interval as found in the source data.

       -s or --summary
              Print a summary of the data, then exit.

       -c or --chpid
              Only  consider  the  specified  physical adapter. Adapters must be specified in hex.  If multiple adapters should be specified, specify each one sepa‐
              rately.

       -x or --export-csv
              Write data to file(s) in CSV format. Output filenames will be based on the data filename.

       -t or --topline
              Repeat topline after specified number of frames.  0 for no repeat (default).

OUTPUT
       Here is a list of the columns and their descriptions.  Timestamps of the frames printed depict the ending of the respective timeframe.

       adapter in %
              FCP adapter utilization in percent.
              min, max and avg gives the minimum, maximum and average utilization respectively.

       bus in %
              Bus utilization of the FCP adapter in percent.
              min, max and avg gives the minimum, maximum and average utilization respectively.

       cpu in %
              Utilization of the cpu on the FCP adapter in percent.
              min, max and avg gives the minimum, maximum and average utilization respectively.

       qdio util.%
              gives the qdio utilization in percent.
              max and avg gives the maximum and average utilization respectively. Note that the minimum value is not reported since it provides no additional infor‐
              mation: You will see the number of queue full encounters rise drastically before the minimum becomes non-zero.

       queue full
              The number of instances where a request to the adapter could not be submitted due to no empty slots left in the outbound queue.

       fail   The number of failures as reported by the FCP adapter.
              erc is the number of error recovery conditions.

       thp in MS/s
              gives  the average throughput over time (transmitted data volume / elapsed time), not over number of requests (sum over all request throughputs / num‐
              ber of requests)! This means that a long-running request with a significantly different throughput profile from the rest will have a bigger impact  as
              a  brief one with the same throughput profile would. This gives a better impression of the overall profile and especially makes requests with very low
              throughputs have a bigger impact, making it easier to detect anomalies.
              rd and wrt give the values for read and write requests respectively.

       I/O reqs
              give the number of I/O requests processed in the respective interval.
              rd and wrt give the values for read and write requests respectively.

EXAMPLES
       Print a utilization report using sample.log , considering adapters 4e and 4f only.  Only data between 8:57 April 5, 2008, and 17:09 June 21, 2008, should  be
       considered.  Data should be aggregated to 60 second intervals.

       ziorep_utilization -c 4e -c 4f -i 60 -b "2008-04-05 08:57" -e "2008-06-21 17:09"
