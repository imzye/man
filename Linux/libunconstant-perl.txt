NAME
       unconstant - sometimes you need to un- em'.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an alternative implementation of constant. This implementation stops perl from inlining the constant, stops constant folding, and stops dead code removal.

       This is supremely useful for testing where a package internally declares and uses a constant that you want to change. This is common when wanting to test modules that make use of constants.

       Note: this module does NOT stop `use` from hoisting the statement to the top.

SYNOPSIS
               # Disable constant optimizations in my_test
               perl -Munconstant ./my_test.pl

               package MyTest {
                       use constant BAR => 7;
                       sub baz { BAR }
               }

               # All of these will change the return of `MyTest::baz()`
               package main {
                       use constant *MyTest::BAR => 42;
                       use constant "MyTest::BAR" => 42;
                       *MyTest::BAR = sub { 42 };
                       *MyTest::BAR = sub () { 42 };
               }
