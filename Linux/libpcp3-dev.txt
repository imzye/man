NAME
       pmDelProfile - delete instance(s) from the current PMAPI instance profile

C SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcp/pmapi.h>

       int pmDelProfile(pmInDom indom, int numinst, int *instlist);

       cc ... -lpcp

DESCRIPTION
       The  set  of instances for performance metrics returned from a pmFetch(3) call may be filtered or restricted using an instance profile.  There is one instance profile for each context the applica‐
       tion creates at the Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI), and each instance profile may include instances from one or more instance domains (see pmLookupDesc(3)).

       pmDelProfile may be used to delete instance specifications from the instance profile of the current PMAPI context.

       In the simplest variant, the list of instances identified by the instlist argument for the indom instance domain are removed from the instance profile.  The list of instance  identifiers  contains
       numinst values.

       The  indom  value  would  normally  be  extracted  from  a  call  to  pmLookupDesc(3)  for  a particular performance metric, and the instances in instlist would typically be determined by calls to
       pmGetInDom(3) or pmLookupInDom(3).

       If indom equals PM_INDOM_NULL and numinst is zero, then all instance domains are selected for deletion.  If instlist is NULL, then all instances in the selected domain(s) are removed from the pro‐
       file.

       To disable all available instances in all domains, use pmDelProfile(PM_INDOM_NULL, 0, NULL).  This is the only situation in which indom may be PM_INDOM_NULL.

CAVEAT
       It is possible to delete non-existent instance domains and non-existent instances from an instance profile.  None of the routines that use the instance profile will ever issue an error if  you  do
       this.  The cost of checking, when checking is possible, outweighs any benefits.

DIAGNOSTICS
       PM_ERR_PROFILESPEC
              indom was PM_INDOM_NULL and instlist was not empty
