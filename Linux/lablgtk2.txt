              (Warning: Invalid formats may behave differently from

              previous OCaml versions, and will become always-rejected in future OCaml versions. You should always use this flag to detect invalid formats so you can fix them.)

       -no-strict-formats
              Accept invalid formats accepted by legacy implementations (default)

              (Warning: Invalid formats may behave differently from

       -w <list>
              Enable or disable warnings according to <list>:

       +<spec>
              enable warnings in <spec>

       -<spec>
              disable warnings in <spec>

       @<spec>
              enable warnings in <spec> and treat them as errors

              <spec> can be:

       <num>  a single warning number

       <num1>..<num2>
              a range of consecutive warning numbers

       <letter>
              a predefined set

              default setting is "+a-4-6-7-9-27-29-30-32..42-44-45-48-50-60-66-67-68"

       -color {auto|always|never}
              Enable or disable colors in compiler messages

              The following settings are supported:

       auto   use heuristics to enable colors only if supported

       always enable colors

       never  disable colors

              The default setting is 'auto', and the current heuristic checks that the TERM environment variable exists and is not empty or "dumb", and that isatty(stderr) holds.

              If  the  option is not specified, these setting can alternatively be set through the OCAML_COLOR environment variable.  -error-style {contextual|short}  Control the way error messages and warn‐
              ings are printed

              The following settings are supported:

       short  only print the error and its location

       contextual
              like "short", but also display the source code snippet corresponding to the location of the error

              The default setting is 'contextual'.

              If the option is not specified, these setting can alternatively be set through the OCAML_ERROR_STYLE environment variable.  -dno-unique-ids  (undocumented) -dunique-ids  (undocumented) -dno-lo‐
              cations  (undocumented) -dlocations  (undocumented) -dsource  (undocumented) -dparsetree  (undocumented) -dtypedtree  (undocumented) -drawlambda  (undocumented) -dlambda  (undocumented) -dinstr
              (undocumented) -args <file> Read additional newline-terminated command line arguments

              from <file>

       -args0 <file> Read additional null character terminated command line arguments

       from <file>
