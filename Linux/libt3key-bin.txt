NAME
       t3keyc - terminal key sequences database checker

SYNOPSIS
       t3keyc [<OPTIONS>] <FILE>

DESCRIPTION
       t3keyc  checks  a  terminal  key sequence description for use with libt3key. The database files should either be put in the global database (normally /usr/share/libt3key or similar), or in the XDG
       Data Home directory (found under ~/.local/share/libt3key if $XDG_DATA_HOME is not set).

OPTIONS
       t3keyc accepts the following options:

       -l, --link
              Create links for the aliases of the key sequence description, instead of checking.

       -t, --trace-circular-use
              Show a trace for circular '_use' references.

       -v, --verbose
              Print verbose warning messages.

FORMAT
       The format of the input is documented in the file format.txt located in the documentation directory. On Un*x systems this is usually /usr/share/doc/libt3key-0.2.10.

BUGS
       If you think you have found a bug, please check that you are using the latest version of libt3key [http://os.ghalkes.nl/libt3key.html]. When reporting bugs, please include a minimal  example  that
       demonstrates the problem.
