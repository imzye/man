NAME
       ESyS-Particle - HPC Discrete Element Modelling Software.

SYNOPSIS
       mpirun -np 3 esysparticle script.py
       Parameter -np should correspond to the number of threads.

DESCRIPTION
       ESyS-Particle  ESyS-Particle  is  Open  Source  software  for  particle-based  numerical modelling. The software implements the Discrete Element Method (DEM), a widely used technique for modelling
       processes involving large deformations, granular flow and/or fragmentation. ESyS-Particle is designed for execution on parallel supercomputers, clusters or multi-core PCs running a Linux-based op‐
       erating system. The C++ simulation engine implements spatial domain decomposition via the Message Passing Interface (MPI). A Python wrapper API provides flexibility in the design of numerical mod‐
       els, specification of modelling parameters and contact logic, and analysis of simulation data.  ESyS-Particle has been used to simulate earthquake nucleation,  comminution  in  shear  cells,  silo
       flow, rock fragmentation, and fault gouge evolution, to name but a few applications.
