NAME
       clamassassin - email virus filter wrapper for ClamAV for use in procmail and other applications

SYNOPSIS
       clamassassin

DESCRIPTION
       clamassassin  is  a  simple script for virus scanning an e-mail message as a filter. An email message is read on stdin, scanned for viruses with the ClamAV antivirus engine, and annotated with the
       results of the scan on stdout.

       If a message is virus infected, the X-Virus-Status header is set to Yes and the X-Virus-Report header is set to the virus(es) found.

       If the message is fine, it is passed through with X-Virus-Status set to No.
