NAME
       xdemorse - GTK+ Morse Code Decoding Software

SYNOPSIS
       xdemorse [ -v | -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xdemorse command.

       xdemorse(1) is a X/GTK+ application for decoding Morse code signals into text.

       xdemorse(1)  detects  the "dihs" and "dahs" that make a Morse code character via the computer's sound card, which can be connected to a radio receiver tuned to a CW Morse code transmission or to a
       tone generator. The input signal is processed by a Goertzel tone detector algorithm which produces "mark" or "space" (signal/no signal) outputs and the resulting stream of Morse code "elements" is
       decoded into an ASCII character for printing to the Text viewer.

OPTIONS
       -h     print a short help message

       -v     print xdemorse(1) version
