NAME
       Scalar::Listify - produces an array(ref)? from a scalar value or array ref.

SYNOPSIS
         use Scalar::Listify;

         $text_scalar = 'text';
         $aref_scalar = [ 1.. 5 ];

         print join ':', listify $text_scalar; # => text
         print join ':', listify $aref_scalar; # => 1:2:3:4:5

DESCRIPTION
       A lot of Perl code ends up with scalars having either a single scalar value or a reference to an array of scalar values. In order to handle the two conditions, one must check for what is in the
       scalar value before getting on with one's task. Ie:

         $text_scalar = 'text';
         $aref_scalar = [ 1.. 5 ];

         print ref($text_scalar) ? (join ':', @$text_scalar) : $text_scalar;

       And this module is designed to address just that!

   EXPORT
       listify() - listify takes a scalar as an argument and returns the value of the scalar in a format useable in list contexts.

       listify_aref() - returns [ listify (@_) ]
