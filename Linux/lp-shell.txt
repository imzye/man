NAME
       lp-shell - Open an interactive launchpadlib shell.

SYNOPSIS
       lp-shell [-a] [-cPROGRAM] [--python] [--ipython] [service] [LP API version]

DESCRIPTION
       lp-shell opens an interactive Python shell with a launchpadlib.Launchpad object "lp" which is ready for use.

       It authenticates against Launchpad with the consumer name "udt-lp-shell". When using lp-shell with the -a option it will use the anonymous login from launchpadlib.Launchpad.

       By default lp-shell connects to the "production" Launchpad service using the "1.0" LP API version.

       If  you  want  to connect to another Launchpad service, call lp-shell with the service name as the second argument. lp-shell supports all services known by launchpadlib Python module.  Currently known
       are (list can be incomplete or outdated): "production", "staging", "dogfood".

       A different LP API version can be selected by passing the API version to use as the third argument. Current supported are: "beta", "1.0" and "devel".

OPTIONS
       -a     Login anonymously into Launchpad.

       -c PROGRAM
              Don't enter a shell but only run the specified Python program and exit.

       --ipython
              Use an ipython shell if available (default).

       --python
              Use a regular python shell.
