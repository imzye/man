NAME
       microdc - A command-line based Direct Connect client

SYNOPSIS
       microdc [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       microdc is a command-line based Direct Connect client that uses the GNU Readline library for user interaction. It was developed from ground up and does not depend on any other program. Despite the
       command-line user interface, microdc was designed to be user friendly and simple to use.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`--').

       -c, --config=FILE
              Read configuration script from FILE rather than ~/.microdc/config.

       -n, --no-config
              Do not read config file on startup.

       --help Show summary of options.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.

       --filelist_refresh_interval=NUMBER
              Local  filelist refresh interval (in seconds). If set to zero, program runs in a special slave mode: it never updates the file list, just checks every minute if the filelist changes, and if
              so - reads it. This is pretty useful if you connect to several hubs and use same filelist.

FILES
       The following files are used by microdc (~ represents the current user's home directory):

       ~/.microdc/config
              This file is loaded on startup. It contains commands, one per line, that will be executed on startup. You can override loading of this file with --config and --no-config.

       ~/.microdc/history
              This is the command history file. It contains a list of commands that were typed and executed from the microdc prompt. It can safely be removed.
