NAME
       podpath - print the path to the Pod

DESCRIPTION
       podpath prints the path to the Pod. podpath calls stdpods underneath if
       the Pod name includes 'perl'. Otherwise, it searches down @INC,
       printing the '.pod' filename if there is a separate Pod file, otherwise
       printing the 'pm' filename. This accommodates systems where the Pod
       lives in a separate file from the module file.

EXAMPLES
           $ podpath Cwd
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/Cwd.pm

       It works with alternate installations, too:

           $ devperl -S podpath perlfunc
           /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/pod/perlfunc.pod

           $ oldperl -S podpath IO::Handle
           /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00404/IO/Handle.pm

           $ filsperl -S podpath Thread
           /usr/local/filsperl/lib/5.00554/i686-linux-thread/Thread.pm
