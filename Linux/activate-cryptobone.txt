NAME
       Activate-cryptobone  -  A  setup  tool  to tie one specific user to the
       Crypto Bone

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/activate-cryptobone

DESCRIPTION
       The GUI program activate-cryptobone is called by the GUI cryptobone  to
       enable one specific user to use the Crypto Bone. It is necessary to tie
       the use of the GUI to a specific  user  that  will  access  the  Crypto
       Bone's  secret  information as root. This program creates a file in the
       directory /etc/sudoers.d that allows access to "/usr/lib/cryptobone/cb‐
       control"  as root after the user has authenticated with the login pass‐
       word.

OPTIONS
       none

FILES
       /usr/bin/activate-cryptobone
