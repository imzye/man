NAME
       dt-getaddr - command-line test program for the val_getaddrinfo()
       function

SYNOPSIS
           dt-getaddr [options] <hostname|IPv4 address|IPv6 address>

DESCRIPTION
       This utility is a command-line wrapper around the val_getaddrinfo()
       function.  It invokes the val_getaddrinfo() operation for the given
       command-line arguments and displays the return code from the function
       and the contents of the addrinfo structure.

       The exit status for this program is 1 if the answer received is
       trusted, 2 if the answer received is validated, and -1 for an error. If
       no validation is performed, or the result is neither trusted nor
       validated, a value of 0 is returned. The trusted and validated status
       values are obtained using the val_istrusted() and val_isvalidated()
       functions from libval(3).

OPTIONS
       -c, --canonname
           Use the AI_CANONNAME flag in val_getaddrinfo().

       -s, --service=PORT|SERVICE
           Use the specified transport-layer port or service name.

       -o, --output=<debug-level>:<dest-type>[:<dest-options>]
           <debug-level> is 1-7, corresponding to syslog levels ALERT-DEBUG
           <dest-type> is one of file, net, syslog, stderr, stdout
           <dest-options> depends on <dest-type>
               file:<file-name>   (opened in append mode)
               net[:<host-name>:<host-port>] (127.0.0.1:1053
