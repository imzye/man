NAME
       polymake - convex polytopes and polyhedra

SYNOPSIS
       polymake [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       This program provides algorithms that manipulate convex polytopes and polyhedra.  When run without arguments, an interactive shell is started.

ARGUMENTS
       --help Show a help message and exit.

       --version
              Print the version number and copyright notice, and exit.

       [--script] [application::]script_file
              Execute the script stored in script_file.  If the application prefix is specified, that application is loaded and the script file is looked up in its script directory.

       --script [application::]script_file arguments ...
              Execute the script, passing the arguments in @ARGV.

       --iscript [application::]script_file arguments ...
              Execute the script, which may contain interactive commands.

       'code' Interpret the string as a perl expression.

       -      Read and execute commands from standard input.

       file PROPERTY | METHOD [ ... ]
              Legacy mode (resembling polymake <= 2.3): Read the object from the data file, print the properties, or run the user methods.

       --touch file [ file ... ]
              Read the files and write them out; useful for converting from older polymake versions.

OPTIONS
       -A application_name
              Start with this application, ignoring the $default_application and @start_applications settings.

       -d     Produce some debug output; can be repeated to increase the debug level.

       -v     Verbose output; can be repeated to increase the verbosity level.  This is an obsolete option.  Use custom variables $Verbose::* to gain more detailed control.

       --reconfigure
              Rerun the autoconfiguration sections in all rule files.

       --config-path "DIR;..."
              Import  settings  from global configuration files in the given directories.  If the last DIR in the list starts with ~/, use it instead of ~/.polymake to keep the private settings.  The default
              is "user", using only the private configuration located at $POLYMAKE_USER_DIR or ~/.polymake.

       --no-config
              Equivalent to --config-path=none.  Don't read any configuration files.  Don't try to configure rules automatically.  Don't load rule files requiring auto-configuration.

       --ignore-config
              Equivalent to --config-path=ignore.  Don't read any configuration files.  Skip auto-configuration routines in the rule files.

       -n     Dry run mode: show the production rules that would be applied to the object, but don't actually run any.  This is only applicable in compatibility mode.

       -T sec Set a time limit for the execution of production rules.  This option currently has no effect.
