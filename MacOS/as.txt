AS(1)                       General Commands Manual                      AS(1)

NAME
       as - assembler

SYNOPSIS
       as [ option ...  ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       The as command is deprecated.  It is now calls clang to use clang's
       "intergated assembler".

       Clang will automatically run its assembler on files with a .s
       extension.  So you can replace: "as -arch arm64 foo.s -o foo.o" with
       "clang -arch arm64 foo.s -o foo.o"
